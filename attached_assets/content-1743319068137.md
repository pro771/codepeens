## A front-end environment made for testing and sharing

- Support For the Way You Code

The CodePen Editor is highly customizable. There is **autocomplete and Emmet** for speed and accuracy. Plus you can set up smart defaults for starting new work.

- Keep Your Pens Private

Nobody can see your private stuff until _you want them to_, because they are at secret **unguessable, non-searchable, non-indexable URLs**.

- Embed Pens

Completely customize the look of code demos on your own site. Change the look of your site? Just change the theme and all your Embedded Pens change too.

- Asset Hosting

Need to use an image in a Pen? No more awkwardly finding alternate hosting for it, you can drag-and-drop it right onto CodePen and we'll host it for you. And not just images! **CSS, JSON files, SVGs, media files**, whatever!

- Build Entire Projects

Projects is the most powerful feature of CodePen. It's a **full blown IDE right in the browser**, with automatic preprocessing, drag and drop uploading, live previews, website deployment, and much more.

- Collab Mode **Live collaboration on code.** Multiple people can type and edit code in a Pen at the same time, all while still seeing the live preview.
